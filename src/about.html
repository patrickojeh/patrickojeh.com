        I'm a product engineer based in Lagos, Nigeria, where I've worked
        professionally for most of my career (outside of remote roles). During
        this time, I amassed valuable experience working across diverse
        environments, including startups, agencies, and large companies.
      </p>

        By October 2017, I joined a development agency as a designer/developer.
        During this time, I contributed to various projects, including an
        engineering platform for Well planning & design for
        <a href="http://petrocompletions.com/" target="_blank"
          >Petrocompletions</a
        >, the
        <a href="https://afrinvestor.com/" target="_blank">Afrinvestor</a> stock
        trading and investment mobile application, and updates to the in-house
        software, <a href="https://prowork.me/" target="_blank">Prowork</a>. My
        focus was on product design and UI engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following a fulfilling four-year stint at Mobnia, I had the opportunity
        to contract as a product engineer for
        <a href="https://paystack.com/" target="_blank">Paystack</a>. During
        this engagement, I collaborated with a highly skilled team to develop a
        digital archive for the in-house Design Studio.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of June 2023, I joined INITS, a leading software development and
        technology consulting company, where I work as a senior frontend
        engineer.
